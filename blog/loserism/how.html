<h1>How?</h1>
      
<h2><i>"While no one can conciously be a loser, they can get close if they try" -</i> </h2>
      <br>
      <p>Losers advocate for social and communal strife, chaos, and all other things traditionally considered <i>"bad"</i></p>
      <p>They don't have anything constructive to do, but people fail to realise that there is constructiveness in that.</p>
     <strong>Being a loser is their job. It is their life</strong>

      <br> <br>
      <p>For those who desire to be losers, the above is your only guide. While it is impossible for someone to conciously be a loser, if they integrate the above habits into their daily life, they will subconciously practice Loserism.</p>
      <p>And that's the goal, isn't it?</p>
