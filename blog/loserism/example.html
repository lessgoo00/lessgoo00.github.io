<h1>An Example</h1>

<p>As expected, they're back at it. <a class="rwatext" href="https://privacyfreak84.github.io/blog/20-30kidsandaparty.html">In my recent blog post,</a> I wrote about the situation regarding minors illegally consuming alcohol in a party in my apartment complex</p>
<p>The <i class="rwatext">"group"</i> I talk of is the anti-RWA group. They are the perfect examples of losers. They claim that the president of the RWA and his circle are all improperly elected (this is true). They miss no opportunity to spit on his name. In the chats, they keep on ranting and try to cultivate anti-RWA sentiments among the population of my area. Today, somebody said that tomrrow, they're all going to file an official complaint against the president of the RWA with the police. It is likely that nothing will come of this.</p>
      <br>
<p>As you can see, this community of people has nothing constructive to do. They are true losers. Who you should strive to be.</p>
